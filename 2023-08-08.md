More keymappings (these are custom):
Shift + D = select all occurences
Alt/Option + Cmd + Up/Down = add cursor up/down


### Laravel Idea features
- Generate Helper code
   * generates code to help PhpStorm understand Laravel magic

- Autocompletion
   * displays available fields when writing queries, config values, validation rules, etc.

- Code Generation
   * generates anything that `php artisan make:` can do

- Blade components
   * generate a Blade view when defining a route, writing a component tag, etc.
   * can also "Extract to Blade View" in refactor menu

- Auto-completion when creating `$fillable` array

- Auto-generate Resources for a model

Additional:
- an icon is provided that, when clicked, will display all related files
   * ex: on a Model, it will display the test, migration, etc.
