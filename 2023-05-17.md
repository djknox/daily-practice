# [Laracasts: What's New in Laravel 10](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-10)  


Native types
- parameter types and return types have been added
- docblocks have been updated to remove extraneous notes on these


`Str` helper - new `password()` method
- can set length, and whether or not to include letters, numbers, and spaces
```
Str::password();
```
```
str()->password();
```
```
Str::password(length: 18, letters: true, numbers: false, spaces: false);
```


Project scaffolding
- `laravel new` includes new options for installing Breeze, Pest, etc.
```
laravel new myNewLaravelApp --pest --breeze
```
- when starting a new Laravel 10 project, if your default DB (`.env`) does not exist when you run migrations, the app can create it for you


`Illuminate\Support\Facades\Process`
- built on top of Symfony's `Process` component
- can invoke and execute shell commands, run them asynchronously
```
Process::run('npm run build')->output();
```


Laravel Pennant
- first-party package for managing feature flags - `composer require laravel/pennant`
- define features in `AppServiceProvider` and determine authorization
```
Feature::define('new-design, function (User $user) {
    return $user->isAdmin();
})
```
- new Blade directive: `@feature`
```
@feature('new-design)
    // what to render in new-design feature flag
@endfeature
```
- new database table for managing feature flags: `features`
- the closure in the feature definition is not re-run for every request - the database table saves (effectively caches) who is authorized the first time it is run
- if a user's access needs to change, the row in the db table can be deleted/updated
- alternatively, the feature can be activated for the user in a route/controllers/etc:
```
Feature::activate('new-design');
```
- check if a feature is active for the user: `Feature::active('new-design')`
- middleware: 
```
// Http/Kernel.php
'feature' => EnsureFeaturesAreActive::class,
```
```
// web.php
Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    if (Feature::active('dashboard-v2') {
        return redirect('/new-dashboard');
    })

    return 'dashboard';
});

Route::get('/new-dashboard', fn () => 'new dashboard')
    ->middleware('feature:dashboard-v2');
```
