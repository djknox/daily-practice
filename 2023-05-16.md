# [Laracasts: Laravel Security Through Examples (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-security-through-examples/)  


md5 hashes are NOT secure
- md5 hashing and reverse hashing is common/generally available
- if you can figure out how the md5 has was generated, you reverse it

md5 hashes:
- 32 characters string
- hexadecimal: 0-9, a-f

`uniqid(`) and `rand()` are also insecure PHP functions

`random_int()` generates secure psuedo-random bytes
- Laravel: `Str::random()`


Deserialisation Attacks

Do not use `serialize()` where the value can be modified by the user
- if the user can modify the value being passed to `serialize()`, they can inject and execute code
- more secure to use `json_encode()` (+ `json_decode()`)
