# [Laravel Nova Mastery (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-nova-mastery-2023-edition) 


Nova allows creating custom Nova components that will be written in Vue  
- creates a new `nova-components` directory at root of project
- within `nova-components`, a new directory for each custom component is created
   * each component has its own `package.json`, `node_modules`, etc.
   * can be shared across projects

Custom fields: `php artisan nova:field app-name/field-name`
- [Nova Docs - Custom Fields](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/customization/fields.html)
```
FieldName::make('My Custom Field'),
```

Custom cards: `php artisan nova:card app-name/card-name`
- [Nova Docs - Custom Cards](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/customization/cards.html)
- custom cards have their own `api.php` for defining routes
   * Nova axios requests: `Nova.request().get().then();`
   * Routes are prepended with `/nova-vendor/card-name/`
   * Nova `GET` requests (without reloading the page): `Nova.visit()`

Custom tools: `php artisan nova:tool app-name/tool-name`
- [Nova Docs - Custom Tools](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/customization/tools.html)
- custom tools have their own `resources`, `routes`, etc. directories
