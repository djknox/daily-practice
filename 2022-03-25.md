# [Object-Oriented Principles in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php)  


## [Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/1)      

Blueprint, template, etc.
Defines the general behavior and structure of some concept in the codebase.

Find the nouns - these will be classes


## [Objects](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/2)      

An object is an instance/implementation of a class

Static constructors = `public static` function, returns new instance of the underlying class using the class's constructor (`__construct()`)  
- provides a more readable way to create a new object
- `public static` methods (aka "class methods") can be accessed from anywhere in the system (global)
- because they are global, be cautious if they change any part of the system

Example:
```
public static function start(... $params) {
    return new static(... $params);
}
```
- Note on `... $params`: allows you to accept a variable number of arguments (accessible via `$params` array)


## [Inheritance](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/3)      

Inheritance allows one object to acquire the traits and behaviors of another object.  

"is a" --> "A speciality coffee maker _is a_ coffee maker"  
`extends` keyword  

`class SpecialtyCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker {}`  

Creating classes that inherent from a parent class is called "subclassing"  

Creating a new version of an inherited method in a subclass is called "overriding" that method  


## [Abstract Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/4)      

An abstract class provides a template/base for any subclasses
- cannot instantiate abstract classes or abstract methods
- unlike an interface, abstract classes can include functionality  

`abstract class AchievementType{}`

Abstract methods are the signature without the implementation  
- the implementation details come from the subclass
- if an abstract class has an abstract method, the subclasses extending it must implement it 

`abstract public class qualifier($user){};`


## [Handshakes and Interfaces](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/5)      

duck-typing - "if it walks like a duck..."  
- the methods an object implements are more important than its type

A "handshake" is when code is designed to work with another without the design being formalized  

An interface is actually writing down the terms of the contract, where any class that implements the interface must adhere to the contract

`interface`
- a class without behavior
- only method signatures

```
interface Newsletter{}

public class CampaignMonitor implements Newsletter{}

public class Drip implements Newsletter{}
```


## [Encapsulation](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/6)      

The restriction of access to an object's internals  
Protects integrity of object by disallowing unwanted changes  

`public`  

`private`  
- only its class is allowed access
- not actually private in the sense of hidden/confidential/etc.

`protected`  
- only its class and any subclasses are allowed access
