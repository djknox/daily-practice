Rules:
- Goal is to knock down all ten pins
- Each frame consists of throwing the ball twice
- If you knock down all the pins with the first ball ==> "strike"
- If you knock down all the pins with the second ball ==> "spare"
- Each game consists of ten frames.
   * If you bowl a spare in the tenth frame, you get one more balls.
   * If you bowl a strike in the tenth frame, you get two more balls.
- Scoring is based on the number of pins you knock down
   * If you bowl a spare, you add the pins in your next ball to that frame
   * If you bowl a strike, you add the pins in your next two balls to that frame
