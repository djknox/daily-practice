### [Your First Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)

A React component is a JS function that you can sprinkle with markup

How to build a component:

1. Export the component - `export default`
2. Define the function - `function Profile() {}`
   * React component names must start with a capital letter
3. Add markup using JSX

Components can render other components, but never nest their definitions - define every component at the top level

React-based frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Expo, etc.) also generate the HTML automatically from the React components, which allows the app to show some content before the JS loads



### [Importing and Exporting Components](https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)

Moving a component from the root component file to its own file:

1. Make a new JS file to put the component in
2. Export your function component from that file
3. Import it in the file where you'll use the component

```
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
    return <Gallery />;
}
```

Named exports:
- can have many named exports per module
```
export function Button() {}
```
- must be imported like: `import { Button } from './button.js';`


Default exports:
- can only have one default export per module
```
export default function Button() {}
```
- must be imported like: `import Button from './button.js';`
   * default imports can be named whatever you like:  
   `import myButtonComponent from './button.js';`

A convention is to use default exports if the file exports only one component and named exports if it exports multiple components/values

Another convention is to stick to only one style (default or named) or avoid mixing them in a single file to reduce any potential confusion



### [Writing Markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)

JSX is a syntax extension for JS that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. There are other ways to write components, but most developers/codebases use JSX.

JSX Rules:
1. Return a single root element
   * because JSX is transformed into plain JS objects, and you can't return multiple objects from a function without wrapping them in an array, you also can't return two JSX tags without wrapping them in another tag/Fragmenet
   * to return multiple elements, wrap them in a single parent tag
   * can use a Fragment (`<> ... </>`) to avoid an extra `<div>` and not leave any trace in the browser HTML tree

2. Close all the tags
   * self-closing tags like `<img>` must become `<img />`

3. camelCase most things
   * JS has limitations on variable names: can't contain dashes or be reserved words like `class`
   * attributes like `stroke-width` become `strokeWidth`, `class` becomes `className`

Exception:  
`aria-*` and `data-*` attributes are written with dashes, the same as they are in HTML

You can use a converter to make it easier to convert HTML to JSX
- Example: [https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx)



### [JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces)

JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings
```
className="avatar"
```

To add JS logic or reference a dynamic property inside JSX, use curly braces (`{}`)

```
export default function Avatar() {
    const avatar = 'https//...';
    const description = 'Gregorio V. Zara';

    return (
        <img 
            className="avatar"
            src={avatar}
            alt={description}
        />
    );
}
```

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:
1. As text directly inside a JSX tag
    ```
    <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>
    ```
2. As attributes immediately following the `=` sign
    ```
    src={avatar}
    ```

To pass objects in JSX, use double curly braces:
```
person={{ name: "Hedy Lamar", inventions: 5 }}
```

This is commonly used with inline CSS styles in JSX:
```
<ul style={{
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'pink'
}}>
```


### [Passing Props to a Component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)

React components use props to communicate with each other.

Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.

Passing props to a component:
1. Pass props to the child component
    ```
    <Avatar size={100} />
    ```

2. Read props inside the child component
    ```
    function Avatar({ size }) {
        // do something with size prop here
    }
    ```

React component functions accept a single argument, a `props` object
- usually you don't need the whole `props` object itself, so you destructure it into individual props
   * destructuring is done with the curly braces when declaring props in the function definition - `function Avatar({ size })`


Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax (`...`):

Using the spread syntax to pass props can be more concise, although less legible/descriptive

Turn this:
```
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Into this:
```
function Profile(props) {
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <Avatar {...props} />
        </div>
    );
}
```


Passing JSX as children:

When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called `children`:
```
<Card>
    <Avatar />
</Card>
```

Example:
```
function Card({ children }) {
    return (
        <div className="card">
            { children }
        </div>
    ); 
}

export default function Profile() {
    return (
        <Card>
            <Avatar size={100} />
        </Card>
    );
}
```
- the above pattern is very common; the `Card` component doesn't need to know what's being rendered inside of it
- the `children` prop is commonly used for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.


How props change over time

Props are immutable - when a component needs to change its props, it has to receive different props from its parent component
   * when a new `props` object is passed to a child component, the old object is cast aside and eventually the memory it used is reclaimed by the JS engine
   * when you need to respond to user input, use state instead of changing props



### [Conditional Rendering](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)

In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JS syntax like `if` statements, `&&`, and `? :` operators

The conditional/ternary operator (`? :`)

Refactor:
```
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className="item">{name} ✔</li>;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```

to:
```
return (
    <li className="item">
        { isPacked ? name + ' ✔' : name }
    <li>
);
```


Logical AND operator (`&&`)

Use when you want to render some JSX when a condition is true, but render nothing otherwise
- returns the value of its right side if the left side of the condition is `true`
- if the condition is `false`, then the whole expression is `false`

```
return (
    <li className="item">
        {name} {isPacked && '✔'}
    <li>
);
```

Pitfall: don't put numbers on the left side of `&&`  
- to test the condition, JS automatically converts the left side to a boolean
- if the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets the value of 0
   * React will render 0 instead of rendering nothing

Common mistake:  
```
messageCount && <p>New messages</p>
```
- when `messageCount` is 0, React will render 0

Instead:
```
messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>
```


### [Rendering Lists](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists)  

Can use `filter()` and `map()` array methods to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components

Using `map()`:

The array:
```
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
];
```

Create new array of JSX `<li>` nodes using `map()`:
```
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);
```

Returning `listItems` from a React component:
```
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Note: the above example will create an error in the console stating that each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop


Using `filter()`:

The array:
```
const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
}];
```

Use `filter()` to exclude any people that aren't chemists:
```
const chemists = people.filter(person => person.profession === 'chemist');
```

Notes:
- arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after `=>`, so no `return` statement is necessary
- however, a `return` statement is necessary in arrow functions with a "block body"; which means when curly braces are used
- JSX elements directly inside a `map()` call will always need a `key`


Keeping list items in order with `key`
```
<li key="{person.id}">...</li>
```

Where to get the `key`
- data from the database (database keys/IDs)
- if data is generated and persisted locally, use an incrementing counter, `crypto.randomUUID()` or a package like `uuid` when creating items
   * don't generate keys on the fly (`key={Math.random()}`), as these will not match up between renders

Rules:
- keys must be unique among siblings
- keys must not change


Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item
- the short Fragment syntax (`<>...</>`) won't let you pass a key
- can either use a `<div>` or the explicit `<Fragment>` syntax
```
import { Fragment } from 'react';

const listItems = people.map(person => 
    <Fragment key={person.id}>
        <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    </Fragment>
);
```

Note:
- components won't receive the `key` as a prop, it is just used by React itself
   * if the component needs to use the `key`, need to pass it in as a prop:
   ```
   <Profile key={user.id} userId={user.id}>
   ```



### [Keeping Components Pure](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure)

A pure function only performs a calculation and nothing more;
- does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called
- given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result


Detecting impure calculations with `StrictMode`:

In React, there are three kinds of inputs that can be read while rendering
- props
- state
- context

All three kinds of inputs should be treated as read-only

You should never change preexisting variables or objects while your component is rendering

"Strict Mode" calls each component's function twice during development to help find components that are impure
   * wrap your root component into `<React.StrictMode>` to opt-in
   * has no effect in production


Side Effects

Side effects are when things change - such as updating the screen, starting an animation, changing data, etc.

Side effects usually belong inside event handlers
   * event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action (like clicking a button)
   * event handlers don't run during rendering, so they don't need to be pure

Last resort: `useEffect` tells React to execute it after rendering, when side effects are allowed


Benefits of pure functions:
- Components can run in a different environment (like on the server) and serve many user requests
- Pure functions are safe to cache, which improves performance by skipping rendering of components whose inputs have not changed
- Purity makes it safe for React to stop calculating a render at any point, so if a re-render is needed, the previous render can be interrupted
