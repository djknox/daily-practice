## [How Do I Share Data](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/5)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Shared data](https://inertiajs.com/shared-data)  

Shared data is useful for when you need to access certain data in numerous pages  
- example: displaying the logged-in user's name in the site navigation  

`HandleInertiaRequests` middleware  
- contains a `share()` method for defining data that is automatically shared with each Inertia response
- shared data will be automatically merged with the page props provided in the controller
   * be sure to namespace shared data appropriately to avoid conflicts with page props


Accessing shared data with `$page` or `usePage()`  
Examples:  
```
<span>
    {{ $page.props.auth.user.first_name }}
</span>
```
```
import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';

export default {
    setup() {
        const user = computed(() => usePage().props.value.auth.user);

        return { user };
    },
};
```


## [How Do I Reference Named Routes](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/6)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Generating URLs](https://inertiajs.com/routing)  

Named routes are done server-side, so they are not automatically available client-side.  

How to get named routes client-side:  
- generate URLs server-side and include them as props
   ```
   return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
       'create_url' => URL::route('users.create'),
   ]);
   ```

- make route definitions available client-side as JSON, then use this to generate URLs from named routes
   ```
   <script>
      let routes = {{ json_encode($routes) }};
   </script>
   ```

[Ziggy package](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy)  
- automatically makes route definitions available client-side via a global `route()` function
- need to add `@routes` Blade directive to the main layout (before JavaScript)
   * this will output a list of all routes to the HTML of the page, so be aware of this in case of any sensitive routes that should be hidden (can hide them with [route filtering](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy#filtering-routes) in Ziggy) 
- with Vue, it is useful to make `route()` available as a custom `$route` property to use in templates
   ```
   app.config.globalProperties.$route = route;
   ```
Example:  
```
<Link :href="$route('users.create')">Create User</Link>
```

## [How Do I Work With Forms](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/7)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Forms](https://inertiajs.com/forms)  

It is possible to make standard form submissions, but Inertia can intercept form submissions and then make the request to avoid full page reloads.  

```
function submit() {
    Inertia.post('/users', form);
}
```

Unlike with regular AJAX requests, post-submission behavior is handled server-side using a redirect.  

Example:  
```
public function store()
{
    User::create(
        Request::validate([
            'name' => ['required'],
            'email' => ['required'],
        ])
    );

    return Redirect::route('users.index');
}
```

Inertia's `useForm()` helper:  
```
<script>
import { useForm } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';

export default {
    setup () {
        const form = useForm({
            email: null,
            password: null,
            remember: false,
        });
    }

    return { form };
};
</script>
```

Submitting forms:  
```
form.submit(method, url, options);
form.get(url, options);
form.post(url, options);
form.put(url, options);
form.patch(url, options);
form.delete(url, options);
```


## [How Does Form Validation Work?](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/8)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Validation](https://inertiajs.com/validation)  

How form validation errors work in Inertia:  
- submit the form
- if there are validation errors, redirect (server-side) back to the form page and flash the validation errors in the session
- validation errors are available client-side as page props


## [How Do I Manage Flash Messages](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/9)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Shared data - Flash messages](https://inertiajs.com/shared-data)  

Sharing flash messages via `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware:
```
public function share(Request $request)
{
    return array_merge(parent::share($request), [
        'flash' => [
            'message' => fn () => $request->session()->get('message')
        ],
    ]);
}
```

Displaying flash messsages client-side:  
```
<div v-if="$page.props.flash.message" class="alert">
    {{ $page.props.flash.message }}
</div>
```


## [How Does Real-Time Table Filtering Work](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/10)  

This lesson walks through how table filtering is done in the Inertia.js demo app: [PingCRM - Contacts](https://demo.inertiajs.com/contacts)  


## [How Do I Handle Policy Authorization](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/11)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Authorization](https://inertiajs.com/authorization)  

Authorization is best done server-side.  

To check authorization policies on the client-side, pass them as props to the page components.  

Example:  
```
return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
    'can' => [
        'create-user' => auth()->user()->can('users.create'),
    ]
]);
```
