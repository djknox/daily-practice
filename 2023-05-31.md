Creating a dynamic `HasMany` relationship using a subquery:
- instead of using a subquery to get a single column, create a dynamic relationship to hydrate a Model when additional fields or functionality is needed
```
// User.php
// - get a Login model with $user->lastLogin()

public function lastLogin()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Login::class);
}

public functions scopeWithLastLogin($query)
{
    $query->addSelect(['last_login_id' => Login::select('id)
        ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')
        ->latest()
        ->take(1)
    ])->with('lastLogin');
}
```
- `withLastLogin()` scope must be added to any `User` queries where the related `Login` is needed:
    ```
    $users = User::query()->withLastLogin()...
    ```

Alternative (added in Laravel 8.42): `hasOne()->ofMany()` relationship
- [PR #37362](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/37362)
- [Laravel Docs: Has One Of Many](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-relationships#has-one-of-many)
- creates a one-to-one relationship that is a partial relationship of a one-to-many
```
// User.php

public function latestLogin(): HasOne
{
    return $this->hasOne(Login::class)->ofMany();
}
```
- can also use `latestOfMany()` and `oldestOfMany`


Use conditional aggregates to calculate totals:
Raw SQL:
```
SELECT
    count(case when status = 'Requested' then 1 end) as requested,
    count(case when status = 'Planned' then 1 end) as requested,
    count(case when status = 'Completed' then 1 end) as requested
FROM features;
```

Eloquent:
```
Feature::toBase()
    ->selectRaw("count(case when status = 'Requested' then ` end as requested")
    ->selectRaw("count(case when status = 'Planned' then ` end as planned")
    ->selectRaw("count(case when status = 'Completed' then ` end as completed")
    ->first();
```


Use `setRelation()` with circular relationships
```
// Before

$feature = Feature::find(1);
$feature->load('comments.user', 'comments.feature.comments');
```
- the `feature` has already been queried, but it is being eager loaded again
- the `comments` have already been queried, but they are being eager loaded again
```
// After

$feature = Feature::find(1);
$feature->load('comments.user');
$feature->comments->each->setRelation('feature', $feature);
```
- `setRelation()` tells Eloquent that the `comment`'s `feature` relationship is the `$feature` that has already been grabbed from the DB
