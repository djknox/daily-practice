Use [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html) in Vue 3 to create reusable functions



# [Laravel Nova Mastery (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-nova-mastery-2023-edition) 


Usually create a class for an action, but it is also possible to simply pass a closure to the Resource's `actions()` method
```
public function actions (NovaRequest $request)
{
    return [
        Action::using('Verify', function (ActionFields $fields, Collection $models) {
            // code for the Verify action here
        })
    ];
}
```

Standalone actions can be created to execute arbitrary code related to a resource (they do not have to act on any specific instance)
- example: deleting all unverified reviews

Creating a destructive action:
```
php artisan nova:action DestroyUnverifiedReviews --destructive
```
- `--destructive` actions will add a warning modal before the action is executed
