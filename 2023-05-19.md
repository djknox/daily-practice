# [Laracasts: Laravel Queue Mastery](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-queue-mastery)

Create a job: `php artisan make:job SendWelcomeEmail`
- `app\Jobs\SendWelcomeEmail.php` created

Queue configuration: `config/queue.php`
- default queue connection configured in `.env`: `QUEUE_CONNECTION`

Jobs can be dispatched to the queue, but a worker must be running in order to actually run them:
- start a worker: `php artisan queue:work`

Set a timeout for a job by setting the `$timeout` property
```
public $timeout = 1;
```
- after 1 second, the job will be terminated

Set the maximum number of times that the job can be tried before failing by setting the `$tries` property
```
$tries = 3;
```
- after 3 tries, the job will be terminated

Set how long the job can be retried with the `retryUntil()` function
```
public function retryUntil()
{
    return now()->addMinute();
}
```
- after 1 minute, the job will stop retrying and be terminated

To prioritize certain jobs, dispatch them to a named queue and tell the worker to prioritize them when starting it:
```
ProcessPayment::dispatch()->onQueue('payments');
```
```
php artisan queue:work --queue=payments,default
```
