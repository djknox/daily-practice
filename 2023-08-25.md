# [Build Modern Laravel Apps Using Inertia.js (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/build-modern-laravel-apps-using-inertia-js) 


When using dynamic meta properties, Inertia has a `head-key` property to ensure that duplicates aren't created (if there is a layout with its own meta properties, they will be overwritten):
```
<Head>
    <title>My App - About</title>
    <meta
        head-key="description"
        name="description"
        content="Description of my app"
    />
</Head>
```
