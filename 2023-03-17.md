Sections:
- how to create and nest components
- how to add markup and styles
- how to display data
- how to render conditions and lists
- how to respond to events and update the screen
- how to share data between components

### Creating and nesting components

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup

React component names must always start with a capital letter (HTML tags must be lowercase)

```
function MyButton() {
    return (
        <button>I'm a button</button>
    );
}
```

Components can be nested into other components:
```
export default function MyApp() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
            <MyButton />
        </div>
    );
}
```
- `export default`:
   * `export`: makes the function accessible outside of the file
   * `default`: specifies the main component in the file


### Writing markup with JSX

JSX is similar to HTML, but with JS wherever needed. JSX is also stricter than HTML; you have to close tags like `<br />`.

React components can only return one JSX tag. To return multiple JSX tags, they must be wrapped into a shared parent, such as a `<div>` or an empty `<>` wrapper.

```
function AboutPage() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
        </>
    );
}
```


### Adding styles

In JSX, specify a CSS class with `className` (works the same was as HTML `class` attribute):

```
<img className="avatar" />
```

The CSS rules for the class must be in a separate CSS file:

```
.avatar {
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```


### Displaying data

Curly braces ({}) are used for writing JavaScript within JSX markup

```
return (
    <h1>
        {user.name}
    </h1>
);
```

For JSX attributes, use curly braces (instead of quotes) to pass variables:

```
return (
    <img
        className="avatar"
        src={user.imageUrl}
    />
);
```
- `"avatar"` will be a string
- `{user.imageUrl}` will be the `imageUrl` property on the `user` object


### Conditional rendering

Using `if` statements:
- `if` statements do not work inside JSX

```
let content;

if (isLoggedIn) {
    content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
    content = <LoginForm />;
}
return (
    <div>
        {content}
    </div>
);
```

Using the conditional `?` operator:

```
<div>
    {isLoggedIn ? (
        <AdminPanel />
    ) : (
        <LoginForm />
    )}
</div>
```

When no `else` branch is needed, use the logical `&&` syntax:

```
<div>
    {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
</div>
```

### Rendering lists

Use `for` loops and array `map()` functions to render lists

For an array of products:

```
const products = [
    { title:  'Cabbage', id: 1 },
    { title:  'Garlic', id: 2 },
    { title:  'Apple', id: 3 },
];
```

Using `map()` to render `products`:

```
const listItems = products.map(product =>
    <li key={product.id}>
        {product.title}
    </li>
);

return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
);
```
- each item in a list needs a `key` attribute to uniquely identify each item among its siblings
- React uses `key` to know what to do when inserting, deleting, reordering the items, etc.


### Responding to events

Declare event handler functions inside components to respond to events

```
function MyButton() {
    function handleClick() {
        alert('You clicked me!');
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me
        </button>
    );
}
```
- `onClick={handleClick}` has no parentheses at the end because you do not call the event handler function, but rather pass it down. React will call the event handler.


### Updating the screen

To remember info and display it to the screen, add state to the component with `useState`

```
import { useState } from 'react';
```

After `useState` is imported, you can declare a state variable inside the component:

```
function MyButton() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}
```

`useState` provides two things:
- the current state (in the example above: `count`)
- the function that lets you update it (in the example above: `setCount`)
   * pass a new value to `setCount()` to update `count`
(you can give these two things any name you like)

In the example above, the state is initialized to 0 with `useState(0)`  

If you render the same compnent multiple times, each will get its own state

```
function MyButton() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    function handleClick() {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Clicked {count} times
        </button>
    );
}
```


### Using Hooks

Functions starting with `use` are called Hooks

`useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React
- [API Reference: other built-in Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)

In addition to built-in Hooks, you can write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones

Hooks can only be called at the top of components (or other Hooks)
- if you want to use a Hook in a condition or loop, extract a new component and put it there


### Sharing data between components

You'll often need components to share data and always update together

To make two components share state:
- move the state up to the closest component containing them
   * this is called "lifting state up"
- update the component to be able to accept the state, event handlers, etc. as props

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    function handleclick() {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
            <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
            <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

```
function MyButton({ count, onClick }) {
    return (
        <button onClick={onClick}>
            Clicked {count} times
        </button>
    );
}
```
