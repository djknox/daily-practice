# [Object-Oriented Principles in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php)  


## [Object Composition and Abstractions](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/7)  

__Object Composition__
- when one class has a property that points to another class where behavior is located
- combining types to create a more complex object  
- typically done through constructor injection

Example:  
```
class Subscription
{
    public function __construct(StripeGateway $gateway)
    {
        $this->gateway = $gateway;
    }
}
```
- the `Subscription` class is composed of the `StripeGateway` class  

__Abstractions__
In the example above, the `Subscription` class doesn't need to know about a _specific_ gateway such as `StripeGateway`, it can just deal with an interface so that the billing gateway can change more easily (for example; if you move away from using Stripe and start using Braintree)  

Example:  

`Subscription` is composed of a `Gateway` interface:
```
class Subscription
{
    public function __construct(Gateway $gateway)
    {
        $this->gateway = $gateway;
    }
}
```

The `Gateway` interface defines a contract:
```
interface Gateway
{
    public function findCustomer();

    public function findSubscriptionByCustomer();
}
```

The `StripeGateway` conforms to the `Gateway` contract:
```
class StripeGateway implements Gateway
{
    public function findCustomer(){ ... }

    public function findSubscriptionByCustomer(){ ... }
}
```

A new `Subscription` instance can be created with a new `StripeGateway` instance because `StripeGateway` implements the `Gateway` interface:  
```
new Subscription(new StripeGateway());
```


## [Value Objects and Mutability](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/8)      

__Value Objects__  
An object that is defined according to its value/data rather than identity
- Example: three $5 bills on the table are each defined by their value, their identity is not important
- avoids using primitive types for everything
- improves readability
- helps with keeping data consistent

Example: creating an `Age` class rather than using an `int` to ensure that values can't be negative (a person's age cannot be a negative number)

__Mutable objects__: objects that can change 
- can change value of properties directly  

__Immutable objects__: objects that cannot change  
- must instantiate a new object for a new value


## [Exceptions](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php/episodes/9)    

In situations where a clear business rule/requirement is being broken, it could be a good time to create a custom exception  
- should limit creating custom exceptions to important domain-specific requirements

Example: a team can have a maximum of 3 members  
```
public function store()
{
    $team = new Team;

    try {
        $team->add($user);
        $team->add($userTwo);
        $team->add($userThree);
        $team->add($userFour);
    } catch (MaximumMembersReached $e) {
        var_dump($e);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        var_dump($e);
    }
}
```
- `MaximumMembersReached` exception thrown when >3 team members added

__Static Constructors__ on an exception:  
```
class TeamException extends Exception
{
    public static function fromTooManyMembers()
    {
        return new static('You may not add more than 3 team members');
    }
}
```

Throwing an exception with the `static` constructor:
```
if (count($this->members) === 3) {

    throw TeamException::fromTooManyMembers();

}
```

# [SOLID Principles in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php)  


## [Single Responsibility](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/1)  

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.  

Extract logic into dedicated classes so that each class has only one reason to change.

Example:  
`SalesReporter` class handles:
- checking that the user is authenticated
   * move to controller
- getting sales data from the database
   * move to repository class that queries the database
- formatting the sales data
   * move to class that handles formatting data

The SRP version of the `SalesReporter` class:
- uses the repository class to query data
- uses the formatter class for formatting the data  

With this design, the ways that data is queried or formatted can change without `SalesReporter` having to change at all  


## [Open-Closed](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/2)  

Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  
- change behavior without modifying source code  

Why?  
- avoid code rot

When you have a module that you want to extend without modifying;  
separate the extensible behavior behind an interface, and flip the dependencies.  

Example:  

Create an interface that defines how all payments should be accepted:  
```
interface PaymentMethodInterface
{
    public function acceptPayment($receipt);
}
```

Create a class that implements the interface by defining how cash is accepted:
```
class CashPaymentMethod implements PaymentMethodInterface
{
    public function acceptPayment($receipt)
    {
        // implementation for accepting cash as a payment
    }
}
```
- could also create `CreditCardPaymentMethod`, `BitcoinPaymentMethod`, etc.

The main class only knows about the `PaymentMethodInterface`, so any class that implements `PaymentMethodInterface` will work:
```
class Checkout {
    public function begin(Receipt $receipt, PaymentMethodInterface $payment)
    {
        $payment->acceptPayment($receipt);
    }
}
```

Polymorphism - ability to have different behavior while sharing a common interface


## [Liskov Substitution](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/3) 


Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes  
- any implementation of an abstraction (interface) should be substitutable in any place that the abstraction is accepted  

Implementing an interface helps the input conform to a constract, but does nothing about output.  


- Signature must match  
- Preconditions can't be greater  
   * type-checking, `instanceof()`, `is_a()`, etc.
- Post conditions at least equal to 
   * output/return types must be the same 
- Exception types must match  


## [Interface Segregation](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/4) 

A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.  

```
class Captain
{
    public function manage(Worker $worker)
    {
        $worker->work();
        $worker->sleep();
    }
}
```
- the `Captain` class depends on `Worker`
- the `Captain` class also depends on any class that `Worker` depends on  


```
interface ManageableInterface
{
    public function beManaged();
}

interface WorkableInterface
{
    public function work();
}

interface SleepableInterface
{
    public function sleep();
}

class HumanWorker implements ManageableInterface, WorkableInterface, SleepableInterface
{
    public function beManaged()
    {
        $this->work();
        $this->sleep();
    }

    public function work() { /// }

    public function sleep() { /// }
}

class AndroidWorker implements ManageableInterface, WorkableInterface
{
    public function beManaged()
    {
        $this->work();
    }

    public function work() { /// }
}

class Captain
{
    public function manage(ManageableInterface $worker)
    {
        $worker->beManaged();
    }
}
```
- because `manage()` does not depend upon a `Worker` object itself, it can use any object that conforms to the `ManageableInterface` without depending on any particular implementation of `Worker`
- The `Captain` does not need to know about the `Worker`  


## [Dependency Inversion](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/5)  

Dependency Inversion !== Dependency Injection  

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. 
- one class should never have to depend on a specific implementation
- instead, it should depend on a contract/abstraction/interface   

High level modules should never be forced to depend on low level modules 

High level code
- code that isn't concerned with specific details

Low level code
- code that is more concerned with details and specifics
