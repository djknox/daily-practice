Use `$table->rawIndex()` method when creating an index based on an expression
```
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        ...
        $table->rawIndex(
            "(date_format(birth_date, '%m-%d')), name",
            'users_birthday_name_index'
        );
    })
}
```

`Carbon::setTestNow()` can be used to set the `now()` value in Carbon to any value
```
Carbon::setTestNow(Carbon::parse('January 1, 2020'));
```


It's easy to forget to eager load all relationships, which can introduce N+1 issues when Laravel lazy loads them - Eloquent "strict mode" will:
- prevent lazy loading
   * `Model::preventLazyLoading(! $this->app->isProduction())`
- throw an exception when trying to set an unfillable attribute
   * `Model::preventSilentlyDiscardingAttributes(! $this->app->isProduction())`
- throw an exception whe attempting to access an attribute on a model when it doesn't exist/wasn't retrieved from the database
   * `Model::preventAccessingMissingAttributes(! $this->app->isProduction())`

To enable all three aspects of "strict mode":
   * `Model::shouldBeStrict(! $this->app->isProduction());`

Natural Sorting: alphabetical sorting except that multi-digit numbers are treated as a single character
- alphabetical sorting:
    ```
    sort(['January 10', 'January 5', 'January 4']);

    // January 10, January 4, January 5
    ```
- natural sorting:
    ```
    sort(['January 10', 'January 5', 'January 4'], SORT_NATURAL);

    // January 4, January 5, January 10
    ```

To natural sort with MySQL, need to create a custom function in the database (MySQL does not have native support for natural sorting)



Full text searching
- create `FULLTEXT` index using columns that you want to search
    ```
    DB::statement('
        create fulltext index posts_fulltext_index
        on posts(title, body)
        with parser ngram
    ');
    ```
- write query using `MATCH()` + `AGAINST()`
   * add `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier to `AGAINST()` to set search type (by default; `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE`)
    ```
    $posts = Post::query()
        ->with('author')
        ->when(request('search'), function ($query, $search) {
            $query->whereRaw(
                'match(title, body) against(? in boolean mode)', [$search]
            );
        })
        ->paginate();
    ```
    * a score value is generated for each match, and MySQL will order the query results in descending order based on their score if no other ordering is in place
