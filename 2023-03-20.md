## [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)  

### Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy

You can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways:
- Programming
   * think in terms of SRP - the component should ideally only do one thing
- CSS
    * consider what you would make class selectors for
- Design
    * consider how you would organize the design's layers

Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model


### Step 2: Build a static version in React

The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity yet.
- build components that reuse other components and pass data using props
   * props are a way of passing data from parent to child
   * don't use state yet; state is used for data that changes over time


### Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state

Use state to make the UI interactive

Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your app needs and compute everything else on-demand
- for example: store an array of products in state, but read the array length if you need to display the number of products instead of saving the number of items as another state value

Keep state DRY (don't repeat yourself)

Not state if:
- remains unchanged over time
- passed in from a parent via props
- can be computed based on existing state/props

Props vs state:
- Props:
   * like arguments you pass to a function
   * lets a parent component pass data to a child component
- State
    * like a component's memory
    * lets a component keep track of some info and change it in response to interactions
- A parent component will often keep some information in state and pass it down to child components as their props


### Step 4: Identify where your state should live

React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child components

For each piece of state:
1. identify every component that renders something based on that state
2. find their closest common parent component
3. decide where the state should live:
   * often, you can put the state directly into the common parent
   * can also put the state into some component above the common parent
   * if no component makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component

Add state to a component with the `useState()` Hook

```
const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);
```


### Step 5: Add inverse data flow

React does not have automatic two-way data binding; need to explicitly configure event handlers to update state going from child to parent.

1. Pass the state setter down to the child as a prop
2. Use the state setter in an event handler in the child to update state

In parent:
```
    const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
    const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div>
            <SearchBar
                filterText={filterText}
                inStockOnly={inStockOnly}
                onFilterTextChange={setFilterText}
                onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly}

    ...
}
```

In child (`SearchBar`):
```
<input
    type="text"
    value="filterText"
    placeholder="Search..."
    onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)}
/>
```



## [Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)  

In React, it is conventional to use `onSomething` names for props which represent events and `handleSomething` for the function definitions which handle those events.


### Why immutability is important

Mutating:
```
const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
squares[0] = 'X';
// Now `squares` is ["X", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
```

Not mutating:
```
const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
const nextSquares = ['X', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
// Now `squares` is unchanged, but `nextSquares` first element is 'X' rather than `null`
```

Several benefits to the immutable approach:
- avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later
- better performance/avoiding unnecessary re-renders: immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not



## Extra Notes:


### Spread syntax

Spread syntax (`...`) allows an interable to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.

```
function sum(x, y, z) {
    return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(sum(...numbers));
```


### Rest syntax

Rest parameter syntax (`...`) allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array

```
function sum(...theArgs) {
    let total = 0;
    for (const arg of theArgs) {
        total += arg;
    }
    return total;
}
```
