- how to update an array in state


### [State: A Component's Memory](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)

Hooks  

Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (such as state).

Hooks are only available when React is rendering.

Hooks can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks.
- can't call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions
- Hooks must be called before the first `return`

Hooks know which variable they are maintaining because they rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component (React matches Hooks up by their order)
- this is why Hooks need to be called at the top level of components, so that Hooks are always called in the same order

You can add state to a component with a `useState` Hook.
- provides a state variable to retain data between renders
- provides a state setter function to update the variable and trigger a re-render

```
import { useState } from 'react';

...

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

Why state is needed:
- local variables don't persist between renders
- changes to local vairables don't trigger renders

State is isolated and private
- if you render the same component twice, each copy will have its own state
- state is fully private to the component declaring it (parent components don't know about it and can't change it)



### [Render and Commit](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit)

Render lifecycle:
1. Triggering a render
2. Rendering the component
3. Committing to the DOM


Step 1: Trigger a render

A component will render for two reasons:
1. the initial render
2. the component's (or one of its ancestors') state has been updated

Initial render
```
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root));
root.render(<Image />)
```

Re-renders when state updates
- updating your component's state (with the `set` function) automatically queues a render


Step 2: React renders your components

- on initial render, React will call the root component
- for subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render

The rendering process is recursive - it will continue until there are no more nested components
- there are several opt-in ways to optimize this for performance


Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM

After rendering the components, React will modify the DOM
- for the initial render: React will use the `appendChild()` DOM API to put all the DOM notes it has created on screen
- for re-renders: React will apply the minimal necessary operations to make the DOM match the latest rendering output
   * the minimal necessary operations are calculated while rendering



### [State as a Snapshot](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot)

Rendering means that React is calling your component (components are functions)
- the JSX returned from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time
   * props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated using its state at the time of the render

Re-renders:
1. React calls the function again
2. the function returns a new JSX snapshot
3. React then updates the screen (commits to the DOM) to match the snapshot that has been returned

Setting state only changes it for the next render (before the component is re-rendered, the state value will not change)
- a state variable's value never changes within a render - even if its event handler's code is asynchronous

To read the latest state before a re-render, use a state updater function
