Transitions


React Community library: [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)  


`CSSTransition`

```
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

<CSSTransition
    in={showMessage}
    timeout={300}
    classNames={alert}
    unMountOnExit
>
    // ...
</CSSTransition>
```
- `in`: when true, the component will receive the first transition class
- `timeout`: how long the transition should take (in milliseconds)
- `classNames`: CSS classes to join to existing styles during each transition state
- etc.

`classNames`: CSS classes for each state (appears, enters, exits)  
- can be passed individually, or as a single name (the prefix of all the classes)
Examples:
```
// passing with prefix

classNames={fade}
```
```
// passing each independently

classNames={{
 appear: 'fade-appear',
 appearActive: 'fade-active-appear',
 appearDone: 'fade-done-appear',
 enter: 'fade-enter',
 enterActive: 'fade-active-enter',
 enterDone: 'fade-done-enter',
 exit: 'fade-exit',
 exitActive: 'fade-active-exit',
 exitDone: 'fade-done-exit',
}}
```


`TransitionGroup`
- manages a set of transition components
- example: adding/removing items from a todo list: the items are children of `<CSSTransition>` (which defines their animation behavior) and `<TransitionGroup>` manages all of them


`SwitchTransition`
- by default, transitions will happen sequentially ("`in-out`")
   * example: one component exits, another component enters
- sometimes its better to have more seamless transitions ("`out-in`")
   * example: a todo list item exits, and a "no todos left" message enters immediately after
- `SwitchTransition` lets you choose which mode of transition to use (`in-out`/`out-in`)
   * if a `mode` is not set, the default will be `out-in`
