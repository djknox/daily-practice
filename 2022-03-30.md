## [Hello Ping](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/1)  

__Inertia.js__
- create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps
- intercepts requests and fires AJAX request in the background


## [Routing to Vue Components](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/2)  

Blade is only used for the layout file(s) - ex: `layouts/app.blade.php`  

Previously:
```
class DashboardController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('dashboard.index');
    }
}
```

Using Inertia.js:
```
class DashboardController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Inertia::render('Dashboard/Index', [
            'foo' => 'bar',
        ]);
    }
}
```
- `Inertia::render()` loads the `Dashboard/Index` Vue component  
- the props `['foo' => 'bar']` are sent to the Vue component  


`Link` component:
```
import { Link } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3'

<Link href="/">Home<Link>
```
- intercepts click event and makes request as an AJAX call


`Inertia` base component:  
- `auth`, `errors`, and `flash` passed to every page (shared data)

## [The Inertia Directive and Persistent Layouts](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/3)  

__The Inertia Directive: `@inertia`__  
- Added to main blade layout  
- Blade directive that expands to the root `div` that main Vue component will mount to
- Passes component/prop information from the controller via a `data-page` attribute on the `div`  
   * loaded in Vue app: `initialPage: JSON.parse(el.dataset.page)`


__Persistent Layouts__
- [Inertia.js Docs: Persistent layouts](https://inertiajs.com/pages#persistent-layouts)  
- maintain layout state when navigating between pages
- examples of when this is useful:
   * maintain scroll position in navigation between page visits
   * built-in audio player continues playing between page visits

Example:  
```
<script>
    import Layout from './Layout';

    export default {

        layout: Layout,

    }
</script>
```


## [How Do I Manage HTML Metadata](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-inertia-with-jeffrey/episodes/4)  

[Inertia.js Docs: Title & meta](https://inertiajs.com/title-and-meta)  

__`Head` component__  
- can be used to set the page `<title>`, `<meta>`, and other `<head>` elements  

Example:  
```
import { Head } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';

<Head>
    <title>Your page title</title>

    <meta name="description" description="Your page description"></meta>
</Head>
```
