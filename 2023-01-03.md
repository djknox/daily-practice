## [Introduction and Demo](https://laracasts.com/series/beginning-react/episodes/1)  

`npx create-react-app {app-name}`  
- create a new React app

`public/index.html` - single page, has `<div id="root">` --> app is mounted to `root`  

`src/index.js` - mounts `<App />`to `root`  

`src/App.js` - function, returns JSX  

JSX - anything inside `{ }` is interpreted as JavaScript  

`const [count, setCount] = useState();`  
- `count` is a variable representing the state returned by `useState` hook
- `setCount()` is a setter for setting the state for `useState` hook

Example of changing `count` using `setCount()`
```
function decrement() {
    setCount(previousCount => previousCount - 1)
}
```

Using a child component:  
`import AnotherComponent from './AnotherComponent';`  
`<AnotherComponent />`




## [A Better Development Experience](https://laracasts.com/series/beginning-react/episodes/2)  

- React Developer Tools - browser extension  
- ESLint - enforces code rules (no unused variables, etc.)
- Prettier - enforces code formatting (semi-colons, line sizes, margin spaces, single/double-quotes, etc.)  
- React-Native snippets - shortcuts for scaffolding React components




## [Make Use of State](https://laracasts.com/series/beginning-react/episodes/3)  

Modern React uses functional components and React hooks
- most components are just functions that return JSX

Before hooks, class-based components were necessary for using state

`useState` hook:
```
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Finish React Series',
        isComplete: false,
    },
])
```
- use array-destructuring to define the variable and its setter function (`[todos, setTodos]`)
- set initial state with `useState()`




## [Event Listeners](https://laracasts.com/series/beginning-react/episodes/4)  

To listen for events in React, use `on` + event name:
- `<form action = "#" onSubmit={addTodo}>`
   * `onSubmit`: the `addTodo` function will be called when the form is submitted
- `<input onChange={handleInput} />`
   * `onChange`: the `handleInput` function will be called when the input changes
- `<button onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)} >`
   * `onClick`: the `deleteTodo` function will be called when the button is clicked
   * any time the function triggered by an event listener has an argument, the function must be passed as a callback
- `<input onBlur={(event) => updateTodo(event, todo.id)} >`
   * `onBlur`: the `updateTodo` function will be called when focus is moved away from the input element



## [Editing Todos](https://laracasts.com/series/beginning-react/episodes/5)  

Conditionally adding CSS classes to an element:  
- `<span className={ ${todo.isComplete ? 'line-through' : ''} }>`
   * `line-through` class is added if `todo.isComplete` is true
