Steps:
1. create a String calculator with a method signature of `add(string $numbers)`
- the method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and return their sum
- an empty string will return 0

2. allow the method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

3. allow the method to handle new linesw between numbers (instead of commas)

4. support different delimiters

5. calling the method with a negative number will throw an exception

6. numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored
