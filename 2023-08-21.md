`IntersectionObserver` API
```
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            loadMoreItems();
        }
    });
});
```
- watches an element and detects if it reaches a certain point in the viewport
- need to pass `observer` a target element to observe

`rootMargin` property
- additional property passed to `IntersectionObserver` object
- adjusts the margin around the viewport that is observing the element
```
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            loadMoreItems();
        }
    });
}, {
    rootMargin: '0px 0px -150px 0px'
});
```
- will trigger `isIntersecting` 150 vertical pixels before the element is reached
- this is useful for triggering the reload slightly before the user makes it to the bottom of the page
