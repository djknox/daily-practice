## [Headless UI Quick Look](https://laracasts.com/series/andres-larabits/episodes/2)  

[Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)  

Completely unstyled UI component library, contain only functionality of the component  
    - only supports Vue 3  
    - use scoped slots pattern in Vue to provide important info to the component  
    - fully accessible/screen-reader ready  


## [From PHPUnit to Pest](https://laracasts.com/series/andres-larabits/episodes/3)  

[Pest](https://pestphp.com/)  
- wrapper around PHPUnit  
- created/maintained by Laravel core team member Nuno Maduro  

Example Pest test:  
```
it('has pest/read page', function () {
    $response = $this->get('/pest/read');

    $response->assertStatus(200);
});
```
- `test()` can also be used instead of `it()`
- `uses()` can be used for traits (such as `RefreshDatabase`)  

Converting a PHPUnit test to Pest:  

`Tests\Feature\ReadPostTest`:  
```
use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ReadPostTest extends TextCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    /** @test */
    public function main_page_lists_all_posts()
    {
        Post::factory()->create();

        $response = $this->get(route('posts.index'));

        $response->assertSuccessful();
    }
}
```

`Tests\Feature\Pest\ReadTest`:  
```
use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

uses(RefreshDatabase::class);

it('lists all posts on the main page', function () {
        Post::factory()->create();

        $response = $this->get(route('posts.index'));

        $response->assertSuccessful();
});
```

__Binding traits and classes in Pest.php__  

[Pest docs: tests/Pest.php](https://pestphp.com/docs/underlying-test-case#testspestphp)  

Tests can be simplified further by recursively binding traits and classes in the `tests/Pest.php` file:
```
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

// Uses the given trait in the "Feature" folder recursively
uses(RefreshDatabase::class)->in('Feature');
```

__Setting up tests__  

`beforeEach()`:  
- same as `setUp` in PHPUnit
- also `beforeAll()`

```
beforeEach(function () {
    $this->post = Post::factory()->create();
});
```

`afterEach()`:  
- same as `tearDown` in PHPUnit
- also `afterAll()`

```
afterEach(function () {
    echo 'afterEach';
});
```
