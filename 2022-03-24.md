# [What's New in Laravel 9](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9)  


## [Controller Route Groups](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/1)    


[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Controller Route Groups](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#controller-route-groups)

Possible to add route groups for controller actions.  
Example:  
```
use App\Http\Controllers\OrderController;
 
Route::controller(OrderController::class)->group(function () {
    Route::get('/orders/{id}', 'show');
    Route::post('/orders', 'store');
});
```


## [Anonymous Migration Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/2)    

[Laravel Docs: Anonymous Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/migrations#anonymous-migrations)  

Migration classes are now anonymous.  

In Laravel 8 and earlier:  
```
class CreatePostsTable extends Migration{}
```

In Laravel 9:  
```
return new class extends Migration{};
```


## [New Helper Functions](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/3)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: New Helpers](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#new-helpers)  

[`str()`](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/helpers#method-str)
- equivalent to `Str::of()`
- returns a new `Illuminate\Support\Stringable` instance of the given string  
- provides object-oriented way to manipulate text (uppercase, lowercase, etc.)
- removes need to import `Illuminate\Support\Str` class

[Simplified redirects:](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#new-helpers-to-route)  

"Redirect to the route named 'home'":  

In Laravel 8:  
```
return redirect()->route('home');
```

In Laravel 9:  
```
return to_route('home');
```


## [Refreshed Ignition Error Page](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/4)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Improved Ingition Exception Page](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#exception-page)  

Updates:  
- Light/dark themes
- "open in editor" functionality


## [Render a Blade String](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/5)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Rendering Inline Blade Templates](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#rendering-inline-blade-templates)  


`Blade::render()`  
- transform a raw Blade template string into valid HTML
- accepts the Blade template string and an (optional) array of data to provide the template

Example:  
```
return Blade::render('Hello, {{ $name }}', ['name' => 'Julian Bashir']);
```

`Blade::renderComponent()`
- render a given class component
```
use App\View\Components\HelloComponent;
 
return Blade::renderComponent(new HelloComponent('Julian Bashir'));
```


## [Forced Scope Bindings](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/6)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Forced Scoping Of Route Bindings](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#forced-scoping-of-route-bindings)  

In a route definition with model bindings, it is possible to scope the second model so that it is a child of the first model.   

Example without `scopeBindings()`:  
```
Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}' function ()) ...
```
- going to `/users/1/posts/9` will return the `Post` with `id == 9` (the `User` id in the URL is ignored)  

Example with `scopeBindings()`:  
```
Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}' function ())->scopeBindings();
```
- going to `/users/1/posts/9` will return the `Post` with `id == 9` that belongs to the `User` with `id == 1`


## [Test Coverage with XDebug](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/7)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Test Coverage Using Artisan `test` Command](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#test-coverage-support-on-artisan-test-Command)  

[Laravel Docs: Reporting Test Coverage](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/testing#reporting-test-coverage)  

Determine how much application code is used when running tests:  
`php artisan test --coverage`  

Define a minimum threshold for test coverage:  
`php artisan test --coerage --min=80.3`  
- test suite will fail if the threshold is not met

Note: need to install [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/code_coverage) for this feature to work.  
- download Xdebug (can use homebrew/PECL/etc.)
- check the PHP configuration file (`php.ini`): `php --ini`
   * if no reference to Xdebug, will need to add `.ini` file
- add `.ini` file for Xdebug: `touch /usr/local/etc/php/8.0/conf.d/99-xdebug.ini`
- add code to `99-xdebug.ini`: `zend_extension=xdebug`
- restart web server

Note: need to set Xdebug's coverage mode
- can do this inline as an environment variable:  
`XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php artisan test --coverage`  


## [Laravel Scout Database Engine](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/8)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Laravel Scout Database Engine](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#laravel-scout-database-engine)  

[Laravel 9 Docs: Scout Database Engine](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scout#database-engine)  

Configure in `.env`:  
`SCOUT_DRIVER=database`  

Configure in `Scout.php`:  
`'driver' => env('SCOUT_DRIVER', 'database')`  

- can use Scout with a database rather than a service like Algolia or Meilisearch
- supports MySQL and PostgreSQL
- executes a "where like" query against every model attribute that has been configured as searchable (in the model's `toSearchableArray()` method)  


## [Full Text Indexing](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/9)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Full Text Indexes / Where Clauses](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#full-text)  

[Laravel 9 Docs: Migrations - Available Index Types](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/migrations#available-index-types)
- `fullText()` can be added to column definitions to generate full text indexes  
- currently possible with MySQL or PostgreSQL  

In migration:  
```
$table->text('bio')->fullText();
```

In query:  
```
User::whereFullText('bio', 'Web Developer')->get();
```

By default, Scout uses `WHERE LIKE` for searching  
- `whereFullText()` uses MySQL's `MATCH() AGAINST()`  
- can configure how specific columns are searched by assigning PHP attributes to the model's `toSearchableArray()`  
- can only apply full text searching to columns that are assigned a full text index (`->fullText()`)

Example:  
```
#[SearchUsingPrefix(['id', 'email'])]
#[SearchUsingFullText(['bio'])]
public function toSearchableArray()
{
    return [
        'id' => $this->id,
        'name' => $this->name,
        'email' => $this->email,
        'bio' => $this->bio,
    ];
}
```
- `id` will have `WHERE LIKE` used to search string prefixes (`example%` instead of `%example%`)
- `bio` will use full text search (`MATCH() AGAINST ()`)
- all other columns will default to having `WHERE LIKE` used to search within the entire string (`%example%`)


## [Enum Attribute Casting](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/10)    

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Enum Eloquent Attribute Casting](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#enum-casting)  

Note: only available for PHP 8.1+  

Can now cast attribute values to PHP "backed enums"  
- [PHP Docs: Backed enumerations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.enumerations.backed.php)  

Example:  
```
enum Suit: string
{
    case Hearts = 'H';
    case Diamonds = 'D';
    case Clubs = 'C';
    case Spades = 'S';
}
```
- a "backed enum" is an enum that contains all Backed Cases
- a "Backed Case" is a case that is "backed" by a simpler value
- simply, an enum is a type with a fixed number of values
- must declare a return type in the definition of a backed enum

Specify the attribute and enum to cast to in the model's `$casts` array.

Example:  
```
use App\Enums\ServerStatus;

protected $casts = [
    'status' => ServerStatus::class,
];
```

Example:  
```
enum Category: string
{
    case Fruits = 'fruits';
    case People = 'people';
}
```
```
Route::get('/categories/{category}', function (Category $category) {
    return $category->value;
});
```
- route is only invoked if `category` is `'fruits'` or `'people'`

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Implicit Route Bindings With Enums](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#implicit-route-bindings-with-enums)
- type-hint an Enum on a route definition
- Laravel will only invoke the route if that route segment is a valid Enum value
- if the route segment is not a valid Enum value, an HTTP 404 response is returned


## [Simplified Accessors and Mutators](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-9/episodes/11)  

[Laravel 9 Release Notes: Improved Eloquent Accessors / Mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#eloquent-accessors-and-mutators)  

In Laravel 8 and earlier:  
```
public function getNameAttribute($value)
{
    return strtoupper($value);
}
 
public function setNameAttribute($value)
{
    $this->attributes['name'] = $value;
}
```

In Laravel 9:  
```
public function name(): Attribute
{
    return new Attribute(
        get: fn ($value) => strtoupper($value),
        set: fn ($value) => $value,
    );
}
```
- define both an accessor and a mutator in a single method by type-hinting a return type of `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute`  
- `get:` and `set:` are named arguments for the `Attribute` constructor
- named arguments are new in PHP 8
