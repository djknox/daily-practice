### [Queuing a Series of State Updates](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates)

Setting a state variables queues another render.

To perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render, you need to understand how React batches state updates.

Batching: React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing state updates (re-renders don't happen until all code in the event handler is executed).

Because React will wait until all code in the event handlers are executed before re-rendering, it's possible to update multiple state variables without triggering a bunch of re-renders.

React doesn't batch across multiple intentional events (like clicks) - each event is handled separately.

To update the same state value multiple times before the re-render, pass a function to the setter method (this is called an "updater function") rather than the state variable:  
`setNumber(n => n + 1)` instead of `setNumber(number + 1)`

When an updater function is passed to the state setter:
1. React queues this function to be processed after all the code in the event handler has run
2. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state

Naming conventions for updater function arguments: name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable
```
setEnabled(e => !e);
setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);
```

Also totally fine to repeat the full state variable name:
```
setEnabled(enabled => !enabled);
setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled);
```
