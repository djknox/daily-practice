Data that changes over time is called state.

- how to make components "remember" information with state
- how React updates the UI in two phases
- Why state doesn't update right after you change it
- How to queue multiple state updates

- how to update an array in state


### [Responding to Events](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events)

React lets you add event handlers to your JSX

Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to user ineractions like clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, etc.

Built-in components like `<button>` only support built-in browser events like `onClick`

Adding event handlers

1. define a function
2. pass it as a prop to the appropriate JSX tag

```
export default function Button() {
    function handleClick() {
        alert('You clicked me!');
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me
        </button>
    );
}
```

Event handler functions:
- are usually defined inside your components
- have names that start with `handle` + the name of the event

Also possible to define an event handler inline in the JSX:

```
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

or inline with an arrow function:

```
<button onClick(() => {
    alert('You clicked me!');
})>
```

Remember to only pass the event handlers, not call them (don't include the `()` after the function name)

Do:
- `<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>`
- `<button onClick={handleClick}>`

Don't:
- `<button onClick={alert('You clicked me!')}>`  
- `<button onClick={handleClick()}>`


Passing event handlers as props

Parent components can specify a child's event handler by passing the event handler as a prop
```
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
    return (
        <button onClick={onClick}>
            {children}
        </button>
    );
}

function PlayButton({ movieName }) {
    function handlePlayClick() {
        alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);
    }

    return (
        <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>
            Play "{movieName}"
    );
}
```
- `Button` accepts an `onClick` prop where it can accept the event handler for the `onClick` event
- `PlayButton` passes `Button` the `handlePlayClick` event handler as the `onClick` prop

In design systems, it is common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior - they get their behavior from parent components that pass event handlers down to them


Naming event handler props

Built-in components only support browser event names like `onClick`

Custom components can have event handler props named anything

By convention, event handler props should start with `on` + a capital letter
- example: `onSmash`


Event propagation

Event handlers will also catch events from any children the component has
- events bubble/propagate up the tree
- exception to this: `onScroll` will not propagate in React, it only works on the JSX tag its attached to


Stopping propagation

Event handlers receive an event object as their only argument
- by convention, it's usually called `e` (stands for "event")

The event object lets you stop propagation by calling `e.stopPropagation()`

```
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
    return (
        <button onClick={e => {
            e.stopPropagation();
            onClick();
        }}>
            {children}
        </button>
    );
}
```
- calls `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the event from bubbling up any further
- calls the `onClick` function which it receives as a prop


Capturing all events even when propagation is stopped

It's possible to capture all events on child elements even if they have stopped propagation by adding `Capture` to the end of the event name
- this can be useful for analytics or routers

```
<div onClickCapture={() => { /* this will run first */ }}>
    <button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
</div>
```
- Each event propagates in three phrases:
    1. it travels down, calling all `onClickCapture` handlers
    2. it runs the clicked element's `onClick` handlers
    3. it travels upwards, calling all `onClick` handlers


Passing handlers as alternative to propagation

Passing event handlers as props to children is a pattern that provides an alternative to event propagation:
```
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
    return (
        <button onClick={e => {
            e.stopPropagation();
            onClick();
        }}>
            {children}
        </button>
    );
}
```
- lets the child component handle the event
- lets the parent component specify some additional behavior with the passed event handler
- makes it easier to trace which handlers execute and why
