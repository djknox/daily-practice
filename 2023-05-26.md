# [Laracasts: Laravel Queue Mastery (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-queue-mastery)

Previous:

Create a job: `php artisan make:job SendWelcomeEmail`
- `app\Jobs\SendWelcomeEmail.php` created

Queue configuration: `config/queue.php`
- default queue connection configured in `.env`: `QUEUE_CONNECTION`

Jobs can be dispatched to the queue, but a worker must be running in order to actually run them:
- start a worker: `php artisan queue:work`

Set a timeout for a job by setting the `$timeout` property
```
public $timeout = 1;
```
- after 1 second, the job will be terminated

Set the maximum number of times that the job can be tried before failing by setting the `$tries` property
```
$tries = 3;
```
- after 3 tries, the job will be terminated

Set how long the job can be retried with the `retryUntil()` function
```
public function retryUntil()
{
    return now()->addMinute();
}
```
- after 1 minute, the job will stop retrying and be terminated

To prioritize certain jobs, dispatch them to a named queue and tell the worker to prioritize them when starting it:
```
ProcessPayment::dispatch()->onQueue('payments');
```
```
php artisan queue:work --queue=payments,default
```

Workflows
- chains
   * run in sequence
   * if one fails, the entire chain will stop executing

`Bus` facade's `chain()` method:
```
$chain = [
    new \App\Job\PullRepo(),
    new \App\Job\RunTests(),
    new \App\Job\Deploy(),
];

\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus::chain($chain)->dispatch();
```


- batches
   * when a job inside a batch fails, the entire batch will be canceled
   * requires a database table for meta info: `php artisan queue:batches-table`
   * a batchable job requires the `Illuminate\Bus\Batchable` trait

`Bus` facade's `batch()` method:
```
$batch = [
    new \App\Job\PullRepo('laracasts/project1'),
    new \App\Job\PullRepo('laracasts/project2'),
    new \App\Job\PullRepo('laracasts/project3'),
];

\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus::batch($batch)->dispatch();
```

Batch methods:
- `->catch()`: runs when a job fails
- `->then()`: runs when all jobs in the batch have run successfully
- `->finally()`: runs when the batch has finished executing

Run chains of jobs in a batch by putting them into an array:
```
Bus::batch([
    [
        new Job(),
        new AnotherJob(),
    ],
    [
        new JobInADifferentChain(),
    ]
])->dispatch();
```

Run batches in a chain by using a closure:
```
Bus::chain([
    new FirstJobInTheChain(),
    fn () => Bus::batch([
        new FirstJobInTheBatch(),
    ])->dispatch(),
])->dispatch();
```

Race condition: when two or more processes try to make changes to the same resource at the same time
- some methods to prevent race conditions include rate limiting via `Cache::lock`, job middleware, or the `RateLimiter` facade

Example:
```
public function handle()
{
    // allow one job to process every 5 seconds

    Redis::throttle('deployments')
        ->block(0)
        ->allow(1)
        ->every(5)
        ->then(fn () => ...);
}
```

`WithoutOverlapping` middleware
- prevents a job from running while an instance of the same job is already running
- can set a second parameter for the number of seconds to delay the job when another instance is already running
```
public function middleware()
{
    return [
        new WithoutOverlapping('deployments', 10),
    ];
}
```
