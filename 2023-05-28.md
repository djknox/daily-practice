`ShouldBeUnique` interface
- prevents having multiple instances of a job in the queue
- by default, the job's class name is the key
   * can create a custom key by implementing `uniqueId()` in job class

`ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing` interface
- uniqueness is enforced until the job _starts_ processing, instead of when the job finishes
- a second instance of the same job can be queued as soon as the first job begins processing

`ThrottlesExceptions` middleware
- delays processing if the job fails too many time
- configure the number of failures to allow - when the number is hit, the job will be released back to the queue
```
public function middleware()
{
    return [
        new ThrottlesExceptions(10),
    ];
}
```
- if the job fails 10 consecutive times, the middleware prevents any more processing


`->afterCommit()`
- when dispatching a job inside a database transaction, `->afterCommit()` can be used to only dispatch the job after the transaction has completed
```
DB::transaction(function () {
    $user = User::create([ ... ]);

    SendWelcomeEmail::dispatch($user)->afterCommit();
});
```
- this can be configured globally in `queue.php`:
```
'connections' => [
    'database' => [
        'after_commit' => true,
    ]
];
```

`ShouldBeEncrypted` interface
- payload of the job will be encrypted


Forge servers use Supervisor for monitoring/controlling processes
- create a worker from the Forge dashboard
- run `php artisan queue:restart` in deployment script to restart worker
