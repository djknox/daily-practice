# [Reviewing changes in pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests)  


## [About pull request reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)  

A review has three possible statuses:
- `Comment`: submit general feedback without aproving/requesting changes
- `Approve`: submit feedback and approve merging the changes
- `Request changes`: submit feedback that must be addressed before merging




## [Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)  

Add comments to specific lines of code and click "Start a review"
   * Note: "Add single comment" button will submit the comment and send notifications to anyone watching the PR/repo
- before submitting the review, line comments are pending and only visible to you
- comments can be edited at any time
- the pending review can be cancelled at any time

Mark files as viewed after reviewing them  

Submitting a review:
- on the "Files changed" tab, click the "Review changes" button
- write a comment that summarizes the feedback
- select one of the three review statuses (Comment, Approve, or Request changes)
- click "Submit review"
