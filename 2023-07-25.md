# [Laracasts: Long-form Refactoring Workshops - Beware the Flying V Complication](https://laracasts.com/series/refactoring-workshops/episodes/2)  
- [source code](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/9e8a3ea79d7696631d7afaa3d775bf47)


Flying V: when code has many indentations and it resembles a V
```
function myFunction() {
    if (someBoolean) {
        function anotherFunction() {
            if (someOtherBoolean) {
                doSomething();
            }
        }
        anotherFunction()
    }
}
```
- remove functions defined within other functions
- remove temporary variables
- refactor to objects + methods
- find confusing pieces of code (look for code that needs a comment to explain it) and refactor to an appropriately-named function


### Other notes:
Tailwind: `.grid` + `.place-items-center` to center text in the middle of a page:
```
<div class="grid place-items-center">
    <h1>This will be centered.</h1>
</div>
```

In JS, it is possible to define and call a function at the same time:
```
(function myFunction() {
    // body of function
})();
```

Promises:
```
function pause(milliseconds) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds);
    });
}

pause(2000).then(() => {
    alert('pause is done!');
});
```
- "I promise to inform you when I'm done" --> a promise will tell its caller when it has finished executing --> it does this by calling a `resolve()` function
- `resolve()` is called when the promise is done, which triggers `then()`

Promises --> `await`
- `then()` can be removed in favor of `await`
- NOTE: this can only be done in a function that is declared `async`
- ANOTHER NOTE: declaring a function as `async` will automatically make it return a Promise
```
async myFunction() {
    await pause(2000);

    alert('pause is done!);
}
```
