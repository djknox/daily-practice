Signed routes
```
URL::signedRoute('books.preview', $book)
```
```
Route::get('books/{book}/preview', BookPreviewController::class)->middleware('signed');
```
- appends a hash to the query string that allows Laravel to verify that the URL has not been modified since it was created
   * hash is cryptographically generated from the URL and its parameters (therefore, the URL cannot be changed without breaking the hash)
- useful for routes that are publicly accessibly and need a layer of protection against URL manipulation
   * examples: unsubscribe links, confirming emails, etc. 

Temporary signed routes
```
URL::temporarySignedRoute('books.preview', now()->addMinute(), $book)
```
- adds an `expires` query param
- second argument (`now()->addMinute()`) is how long the route should be valid


Type juggling

Type juggling is when PHP automatically converts the type of a value to another in certain contexts
- example: `10 == "10"` --> PHP converts `10` into a string to compare them

Unless there is a specific reason to type-juggle, always use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`)
- legitimate reasons to use loose comparisons: boolean checks, comparing ints and floats, etc.

Use `hash_equals()` to compare two strings while taking the same amount of time for comparison whether they are equal or not
- this protects against timing attacks (because more similiar strings take longer to compare, it's possible to incrementally figure out a key by measuring the comparison times as they get longer and longer)
