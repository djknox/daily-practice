throttle vs. debounce:  
- throttle: waits a set amount of time between requests
   * good for providing quicker feedback to user
- debounce: waits a set amount of time after event finishes
   * good for protecting server from too many requests



Inertia `Link` component has a `method` argument to set the request method (defaults to `GET`):
```
<Link href="/logout" method="post">
    Log Out
</Link>
```
