# [Laracasts: Laravel Security Through Examples (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-security-through-examples/)  


Laravel uses [commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) for markdown parsing
- when parsing markdown, commonmark options can be set using an array as the second argument to `Str::markdown()`

```
Str::markdown("<script>alert('Boom!')</script>", [
    'html_input' => 'escape',
    'allow_unsafe_links' => false
]);
```

HTML santizers/purifiers are other tools that can be used to:
- deconstruct markdown into its individual elements
- only allow elements that have been configured to be allowed


Hiding sensitive attributes:
- on a model, add any sensitive attributes to the `$hidden` array to avoid sending them in requests
   * this loads all attributes and then filters what is contained in `$hidden`
- add a `->select()` clause that contains only the desired attributes
   * `return Book::published()->select('title', 'description')->get();`
- create a Resource that is used to translate how the model should be returned in responses
   * `php artisan make:resource BookResource`
```
// Resource:
class BookResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray($request)
    {
        return [
            'title' => $this->title,
            'description' => $this->description,
        ];
    }
}

// Controller, Route, etc.:
return BookResource::collection(Book::published()->get());
```

Must have rate limiting on endpoints to ensure security/prevent abuse
- `ThrottleRequests` middleware - by default, added to `api` middleware
- `RateLimiter` facade
- botnets can bypass rate limiting by using different IP addresses
   * if possible, remove IP address from consideration when rate limiting to protect against botnets
   * Example: this code combines the email address and IP of the request to determine uniqueness of the request
   ```
   public function throttleKey()
   {
        return Str::transliterate(Str::lower($this->input('email').'|'.$this->ip()));
   }
   ```
   Remove IP address from key:
   ```
   public function throttleKey()
   {
        return Str::transliterate(Str::lower($this->input('email')));
   }
   ```
