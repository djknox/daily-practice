Open-Closed Principle:  
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.


[Collections: Higher Order Messages](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/collections#higher-order-messages)  
- short-cuts for performing common actions on collections
   * examples: `average`, `contains`, `each`, `filter`, etc.
- each higher order message can be accessed as a dynamic property on a collection instance

Example:  
```
$users->each->markAsVip();
```


Service Providers are responsible for registering services in the app's service container.
- done in the `register()` method of the Service Provider
- Service Providers also have a `boot()` method for performing any actions that should be executed when the app starts up
