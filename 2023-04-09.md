### [Updating Objects in State](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state)

Don't directly change objects that you hold in React state. Instead, when updating an object, create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one) and set the state to use that object.

Treat objects in React state as if they were immutable, or read-only.

Many times you'll want to include existing data as part of the new object. For example, to update only one field in a form. Use the spread syntax (`...`) to copy existing data into a new object:

```
setPerson({
    ...person,
    firstName: e.target.value
});
```
- copies the old fields from `person`, but overrides `firstName`

Use square brackets (`[]`) inside the object definition to specify a property with a dynamic name;

```
function handleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
        ...person,
        [e.target.name]: e.target.value
    });
}
```
- `e.target.name` refers to the `name` property given to the DOM element
- can use the square brackets to use a single event handler for updating multiple properties


The spread syntax is shallow, meaning it only copies one level deep. To update a nested property, use the spread syntax multiple times and create copies all the way up from the property being updated.

Example of a nested state object:
```
const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name:  'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
        title: 'Blue Nana',
        city: 'Hamburg',
    }
});
```

To change `artwork.city`, you have to create a new object for `artwork` and then create a new object for `person` containing it:
```
const nextArtwork = {...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi'};
const nextPerson = {...person, artwork: nextArtwork};
```

As a single function call:
```
setPerson({
    ...person,
    artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        city: 'New Delhi'
    }
});
```

[Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) is a library that handles making copies for you and allows you to write code that looks like you're directly mutating objects. Immer is a great way to keep update handlers concise, especially if there are nested state objects.

```
updatePerson(draft => {
    draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';
});
```
- `draft` is a special type of object, called a Proxy, that records what is done to it. Immer figures our which parts of `draft` have changed and produces a new object that contains the updates.
- [JS Docs: Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
- to use Immer, replace the `useState` hook with `useImmer` (after installing it as an npm dependency):
```
import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';
```
