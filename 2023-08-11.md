# [Demystify Laravel's Magic](https://laracasts.com/series/demystifying-laravel-magic)  

### Aliases
- classes are aliased in Laravel with the `class_alias()` function
```
class_alias('App\Models\User', 'User');
```
```
(no import needed)

$user = new User();
```
- Tinker uses this for auto-aliasing classes


### How Facades work:
- `Facade` base class (inherited by all facades) has a `__callStatic()` method
   * PHP magic method that intercepts calls to static methods that don't actually exist in the class
   * calls `getFacadeRoot()` to get some instance and call the static method on that instance
- The facade acts as a proxy to an underlying class instance
   * the underlying class instance is resolved by `resolveFacadeInstance()`, which asks the dependency container for a binding with the name of the facade accessor


### Real-time Facades
- treat any class in the app as if it was a facade by prepending `Facades\` to the import
   * magic is handled by `AliasLoader` class
- a class that has a namespace that starts with `Facades\` is treated as a real-time facade by Laravel
   * the implementation of the class will be resolved out of the service container using what appears after `Facades\`
```
// normal
use App\Contracts\Publisher;

real-time facade
use Facades\App\Contracts\Publisher;
```
- Laravel creates a `class Publisher extends Facade` to use, which allows you to call the `Publisher` class methods as if they were static methods


### Reflection API
- reflection is the ability of a program to examine and modify its own code at runtime
- used where dependencies are resolved from the container
   * type-hint the required dependencies and Laravel uses reflection to automatically resolve them from the app container
- used to resolve dependencies and bind inputs in console commands, contextual binding, listening to events, etc.


### Macros
- macros are custom methods that can be registered on Laravel classes
```
Command::macro('correct', function () {
    $this->line('<fg=green>Correct!</>');
});
```
- injects a custom method, `correct()` to the `Command` class

### Mixins
- a mixin is a class of custom methods (macros) that can be registered all at the same time
```
Command::mixin(new MyClassOfMacros());
```
- `MyClassOfMacros` is a class containing the custom methods to be injected
   * each macro must return a closure that will be invoked when the method is called
