# [Build Modern Laravel Apps Using Inertia.js](https://laracasts.com/series/build-modern-laravel-apps-using-inertia-js) 


[Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) was built by Jonathan Reinink

Client-side routing library that connects a server-side framework (Laravel) to a client-side framework (React/Vue)

Inertia has an adapter for the server-side framework and an adapter for the client-side framework

`InertiaProgress` component can be initialized in `app.js` to display the page load progress for each request
```
// app.js

import { InertiaProgress } from '@inertiajs/progress';

...

InertiaProgress.init({
    color: 'red',
    showSpinner: true,
});
```

Inertia intercepts requests and sends AJAX instead
- this is done by using Inertia's `Link` component instead of standard anchor tags
- render a `Link` as a button (rather than an anchor tag) with `<Link href="#" as="button">`
- preserve the scroll position with `<Link href="#" preserve-scroll>`

`$page` property
- provides an `initialPage` object containing the page's url, the component, etc.
```
<Link
    href="/users"
    :class="{'font-bold underline': $page.component === 'Users'}"
>
```
- active link styling: adds the `font-bold underline` classes to the link based on the current page component
