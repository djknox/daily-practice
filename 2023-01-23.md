# [Laravel Docs: Mocking](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/mocking)  

During testing, there may be parts of the app that you don't actually want to execute; sending emails, dispatching events, calling third-party APIs, etc.  

Laravel offers a [Mockery](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/) implementation


## [Mocking Objects](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/mocking#mocking-objects)  

To mock an object, bind the mocked instance into the service container to tell the container to use the mocked instance of the object instead of constructing the object itself:  

```
use App\Service;
use Mockery\MockInterface;
 
$mock = $this->mock(Service::class, function (MockInterface $mock) {
    $mock->shouldReceive('process')->once();
});
```

Use `partialMock()` to only mock a few methods of an object and let the rest execute normally:  

```
use App\Service;
use Mockery\MockInterface;
 
$mock = $this->partialMock(Service::class, function (MockInterface $mock) {
    $mock->shouldReceive('process')->once();
});
```

Laravel's base test class also offeries a `spy()` method, which is a wrapper around `Mockery::spy()`: it will record the interaction between the spy and the code being tested and allow for assertions _after_ the code is executed.  

```
use App\Service;
 
$spy = $this->spy(Service::class);
 
// ...
 
$spy->shouldHaveReceived('process');
```
