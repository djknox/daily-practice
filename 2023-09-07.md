# [Laravel Nova Mastery (cont.)](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-nova-mastery-2023-edition) 


To check for queued jobs, run `php artisan queue:work`  


Nova actions can be queued by implementing `ShouldQueue` on the action class  

Job chunking  
- jobs will chunk records by 200 (one job for 1-200, second job for 201-400, etc.)
- can change the chunk size by setting a `public static $chunkCount` attribute on the action class
- implement `Batchable` interface and add `Batchable` trait to the action class to use Laravel's built-in job batching


Add the `Actionable` trait to a model and Nova will display a log of actions that have executed on the model's resource page  


`runAction()` can be added to a model policy to determine if a user can run actions on the model:
```
// CustomerPolicy.php

public function runAction(User $user, Customer $customer, Action $action)
{
    return $user->isAdmin();
}
```

This can also be done for specific actions in a resource's `actions()` method by chaining `canRun()` to the action
```
// Nova/Customer.php

public function actions(NovaRequest $request)
{
    return [
        resolve(SendCustomerDiscount::class)
            ->canRun(fn ($request, $customer) => return $user->isAdmin()),
    ];
}
```
- this will also hide the action in Nova


`NovaNotification` can be used to send notifications within Nova  
```
$notification = NovaNotification::make()
    ->message()
    ->action()
    ->icon()
    ->type();

$this->user->notify($notification);
```

Note: in an action, the current user will need to be passed in as an argument
```
public function actions(NovaRequest $request)
{
    return [
        resolve(SendCustomerDiscount::class, [
            'user' => $request->user(),
        ]),
    ];
}
```

`NovaChannel` can also be added to a Notification's `via()` method to send it as a Nova notification
- also add a `toNova()` method to define the `NovaNotification`
